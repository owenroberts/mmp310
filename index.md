## Turning in assignments
- Assignments turned in on Blackboard
- Late assignments are 25 points off

## Citations for code resources
- Coding assignments must use citations for any code borrowed from resources outside of class, including Google, Stack Overflow, YouTube or any tutorial, even if it's as little as one line of code
- This is good practice to keep track of resources
- In comments at the top of include a link to the resource

## Statement of Inclusion
This class room strives to be an inclusive learning community, respecting those of differing backgrounds and beliefs.  It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.

This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you go by a different name than what is on the class roster, please let me know. Using correct gender pronouns is important to me, so you are encouraged to share your pronouns with me and correct me if a mistake is made. 

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.
