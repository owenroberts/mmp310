## Project 1 **Interactive story**
- While reviewing variables, logic and functions, we will create an interactive story using p5
- Story elements: character, setting, plot
- [Interactive story inspiration](inspiration/interactive_story/)

## Week 1 **Review**
- [GitHub Review](notes/github)
- [JavaScript Variables](notes/variables)
- **Assignment 1: Characters**
	- Design two characters using p5 shape and color functions
	- Use p5 `text` with variables for the narration
	- Use `x`, `y`, and `size` variables to position the characters

## Week 2 **Logic**
- [Logic](notes/logic)
- **Assignment 2: Setting**
	- Use p5 shape and color functions to design three settings
	- Use logic to display the setting based on user clicks

## Week 3 **Functions**
- [Functions](notes/functions)
- **Assignment 3: Plot**
	- Use functions to draw the characters in different places in each setting
	- Create a story with at least three parts, beginning, middle and end
	- Use text for narration and interaction instructions

<!-- ## Project 2 **Generative Patterns**
- Use loops to create patterns that change  -->

## Week 4 **Loop**
- [Loops](notes/loop)
- [Random](notes/random)
- **Assignment 4: Pattern Variations**
	- Use a loop to draw a series of shape variations
	- Use a click event to generate new variations

## Week 5 **User Interface**
- [DOM Library](notes/dom)
- **Assignment 5: Character Customizer**
	- Use DOM elements allow a user to customize a character
	- Customize at least three visual components of the character

## Week 6 **Arrays**
- [Arrays](notes/array)
- [Drawing with Arrays](notes/array/animation)
- **Assignment 6: Array Animation**
	- Using an array, create an animation
	- Add one other component to the data in the array, color, size or shape

## Week 7 **Objects**
- [Class](notes/class)
- [Class Inheritence](notes/class/inheritance)
- **Assignment 7: Game Graphics**
	- Create the display function for the Asteroid and Spaceship class
	- Using p5 color and shapes

<!-- 

	maybe
- just go to objects
	- classes
	- inheritance
- then arrays
- then work on game
- sound
- graphics, animations
- saving data as levels


## Week 5 **Grid**
- [Grid](notes/grid)
- [Save image](notes/save)
- **Assignment 5: Grid Design**
	- Use a nested loop, create a design for a product
	- Could be a t-shirt, wall paper, bag, anything with patterns
	- Use mouse click to generate new pattern and save as image
	- Choose three design to show in class
	- [Generative landscapes](https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/complex-pattern-from-simple-arcs-example-3-6/){:target="blank"}
	- [Libs Elliott: Generated quilt design](http://themakersnation.com/maker-spotlight-libs-elliott/){:target="blank"}
	- [Generative Patterns Google Image Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=generative+patterns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiA-OPl3fbWAhWD6iYKHTihD7EQ_AUICigB&biw=1897&bih=984#imgrc=_){:target="blank"}


## Project 3 **Data Visualization**
- Using an external data source, create a visualization of the data with p5 shapes and color
- Use arrays and loops to read through data

## Week 7 **Arrays**
- [Arrays](notes/array)
- [Drawing with Arrays](notes/array/animation)
- **Assignment 7: Array Animation**
	- Using an array, create an animation
	- Add one other component to the data in the array, color, size or shape

## Week 8 **Data**
- [Data Files](notes/data/csv)
- [Data Visualization](notes/data/vis)
- **Assignment 8: Data Visualization**
	- Choose a data source and download as a CSV file
	- Use a loop to read data
	- Visualize data with p5 functions

## Project 4 **Mobile Game**
- Mobile events and touches
- Object oriented programming for game elements

## Week 9 **Objects**
- [Objects](notes/objects)
- [Class](notes/class)
- **Assignment 9: Game Graphics**
	- Create custom graphics for the spaceship and asteroids
	- Can use a new theme
	- Randomize one property of asteroids
	- Add one new property to the spaceship

## Week 10 **Class Inheritance**
- [Class Inheritence](notes/class/inheritance)
- **Assignment 10: Laser Sub Class**
	- Create a custom class for game lasers
	- Extend the Entity class
	- Write `display` and `update` methods

## Week 11 **Game Dynamics**
- [Game Dynamics](notes/game/dynamics)

- **Assignemnt 11: Final Project Proposal**
	- Choose one of the projects to continue working on for the final
	- Propose a substantial update 
		- Including updated graphics 
		- New code for added mechanic or feature

## Week 12 **Mobile Interaction**
- Present Final Project proposal
- [Mobile Events](notes/events/mobile)

## Week 13/14 **Final project workshop**

<!--  start with simple array assignment
	use data source in week 2 -->

<!-- 
	rectXY.push([mouseX, mouseY]);
 -->

<!-- ## Week 8 Objects
- [Objects]() -->


<!-- 

game mechanics
custom update / sides etc
difficulty increase
timers
animations
scenes
power ups

- **Assignemnt 11: Mobile Events**
	- Implement mobile events in your game
	- Adjust the speed and properties for game play
	- Add game dynamics to make the game more difficult over time
