<!-- ## Project 1 **Interactive story**
- While reviewing variables, logic and functions, we will create an interactive story using p5
- Story elements: character, setting, plot
 -->

## Week 1 **Review**
- [GitHub Review](notes/github)
- [JavaScript Variables](notes/variables)
- [Interactive story inspiration](inspiration/interactive_story/)
- **Assignment 1: Characters**
	- Design two characters and add with `image` function
	- Use p5 `text` with variables for the narration
	- Use `x` & `y` variables to position the characters

## Week 2 **Logic**
- [Logic](notes/logic)
- **Assignment 2: Setting**
	- Use p5 shape and color functions to design three settings
	- Use logic to display the setting based on user clicks

## Week 3 **Functions**
- [Functions](notes/functions)
- **Assignment 3: Plot**
	- Use functions to draw the characters in different places in each setting
	- Create a story with at least three parts, beginning, middle and end
	- Use text for narration and interaction instructions

<!-- ## Project 2 **Generative Patterns**
- Use loops to create patterns that change  -->

## Week 4 **Loop**
- [Loops](notes/loop)
- [Random](notes/random)
- **Assignment 4: Pattern Variations**
	- Use a loop to draw a series of shape variations
	- Use a click event to generate new variations
	- Combine these to create a new setting for your story

## Week 5 **Arrays**
- [Arrays](notes/array)
- [Drawing with Arrays](notes/array/animation)
- **Assignment 5: Array Animation**
	- Using an array, create an animation
	- Add one other component to the data in the array, color, size or shape


## Week 6 **Objects**
- [Class](notes/class)
- [Class Inheritence](notes/class/inheritance)
- [YouTube Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3R9Q4Qidwg){:target="_blank"}
- **Assignment 6: Objects**
	- Recreate the array animation with classes
	- Add a new class of objects to the animation

## Week 7 **User Interface**
- [DOM Library](notes/dom)
- [YouTube Lecture Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW3nChrIwaA){:target="_blank"}
- [YouTube Lecture Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z57Bzg1ZOI){:target="_blank"}
- **Assignment 7: User Interface**
	- Use DOM elements allow a user to customize three components of a scene
	- This could adjust the number of elements in a scene, the position on the page or any other attribute defined by a number

## Week 8 **3D Graphics**
- Introduction to 3D Graphics
- **Assignment 8: 3D composition**
	- Using p5 3d shapes, materials and lights, create a composition
	- Make anything you think would look good in 3D, such as a character, object, scene
	- Include scene controls to view the scene

## Week 9 **3D Particles**
- Creating a particle system in 3D
- **Assignment 9: 3D Particle System**
	- Design the particles for the particle system and implement then using a class
	- Add animation to size, shape, color, rotation or other components

## Week 10 **Sound**
- Adding sound assets
- **Assignment 10: Sound**
	- Add sounds to the particle system
	- Sound effects for the particles
	- Background sound

## Week 11 **Final Project Pitch**
- Make a short presentation describing your idea for a final project
- The project must include at least 3/5 of the following:
	- Custom function
	- Loop
	- Array
	- Class/Object
	- User interface
- Your presentation must include the following information
	- How will the user interact with your project?
	- What is the theme of your project?
	- How will you create graphics for the project?
- The project can be anything you are interested in making, such as, as interactive scene or story, a simple video game, an abstract visualization, design or pattern, etc.

## Week 12 - 14 **Final Project Workshop**
- Set goals for the week
- Turn in a work in progress site each week

## Week 15
- Final project due


<!-- 

modules-
map
animated sprites
paralax
sound
data

i need to add
- support for p5.play sprites
- p5.play collisions
- data for obstacles, scenery, characters
- moving map
- sound triggers, bg sound
- exit function for changing scenes ....

	maybe
- just go to objects
	- classes
	- inheritance
- then arrays
- then work on game
- sound
- graphics, animations
- saving data as levels


## Week 5 **Grid**
- [Grid](notes/grid)
- [Save image](notes/save)
- **Assignment 5: Grid Design**
	- Use a nested loop, create a design for a product
	- Could be a t-shirt, wall paper, bag, anything with patterns
	- Use mouse click to generate new pattern and save as image
	- Choose three design to show in class
	- [Generative landscapes](https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/complex-pattern-from-simple-arcs-example-3-6/){:target="_blank"}
	- [Libs Elliott: Generated quilt design](http://themakersnation.com/maker-spotlight-libs-elliott/){:target="_blank"}
