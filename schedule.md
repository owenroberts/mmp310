## Project 1 **Interactive story**
- While reviewing variables, logic and functions, we will create an interactive story using p5
- Story elements: character, setting, plot
- [Interactive story inspiration](inspiration/interactive_story/)

## Week 1 **Review**
- [GitHub Review](notes/github)
- [JavaScript Variables](notes/variables)
- **Assignment 1: Characters**
	- Design two characters using p5 shape and color functions
	- Use p5 `text` with variables for the narration
	- Use `x`, `y`, and `size` variables to position the characters

## Week 2 **Logic**
- [Logic](notes/logic)
- **Assignment 2: Setting**
	- Use p5 shape and color functions to design three settings
	- Use logic to display the setting based on user clicks

## Week 3 **Functions**
- [Functions](notes/functions)
- **Assignment 3: Plot**
	- Use functions to draw the characters in different places in each setting
	- Create a story with at least three parts, beginning, middle and end
	- Use text for narration and interaction instructions

## Project 2 **Generative Patterns**
- Use loops to create patterns that change 

## Week 4 **Loop**
- [Loops](notes/loop)
- [Random](notes/random)
- **Assignment 4: Pattern Variations**
	- Use a loop to draw a series of shape variations
	- Use a click event to generate new variations

## Week 5 **Grid**
- [Grid](notes/grid)
- [Save image](notes/save)
- **Assignment 5: Grid Design**
	- Use a nested loop, create a design for a product
	- Could be a t-shirt, wall paper, bag, anything with patterns
	- Use mouse click to generate new pattern and save as image
	- Choose three design to show in class
	- [Generative landscapes](https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/complex-pattern-from-simple-arcs-example-3-6/){:target="blank"}
	- [Libs Elliott: Generated quilt design](http://themakersnation.com/maker-spotlight-libs-elliott/){:target="blank"}
	- [Generative Patterns Google Image Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=generative+patterns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiA-OPl3fbWAhWD6iYKHTihD7EQ_AUICigB&biw=1897&bih=984#imgrc=_){:target="blank"}

## Week 6 **Interactive Patterns**
- [DOM Library](notes/dom)
- **Assignment 6: Interactive Pattern**
	- Using the grid design from Assignment 5, add a DOM based interface
	- Give the user the ability to change attributes of the design such as the number of columns and rows, the colors, the type of shapes, the amount of randomness

## Project 3 **Data Visualization**
- Using an external data source, create a visualization of the data with p5 shapes and color
- Use arrays and loops to read through data

## Week 7 **Arrays**
- [Arrays](notes/array)

<!-- 
	rectXY.push([mouseX, mouseY]);

<!-- ## Week 8 Objects
- [Objects]() -->
