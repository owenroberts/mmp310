<div class="slide">
	<p>JavaScript is a scripting language, a lightweight programming language, specifically designed for adding functionality to the elements of web pages. Today we are going to look at some basic concepts in JavaScript and general computer programming which will allow us to interact with the browser and begin making dynamic designs. When we talk about dynamic design we mean making a design which changes given various inputs and interactions. The power of writing code is that we can build designs that react and change to various input, whether it is user interaction, time, or other sources.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>The Console</h2>
	<p>Let's go ahead and open the JavaScript console (in Google Chrome).</p>
	<p><strong>View > Developer > JavaScript Console</strong></p>
	<div class="key">CAj</div>
	<p>The console in the browser is sort of like the Terminal app for OSX, it's a text based interface for the application.  We're going to add a series of commands and see what happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<p>Start by typing into the console.</p>
	<p><code><c></c> document</code></p>
	<p>Look familiar?  This is our HTML document, interpreted as a node structure by the Document Object Model.</p>
</div>

<!--  writing stuff to dom / what is the dom? -->
<div class="slide">
	<p>Quick aside: What is the document object model?</p>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="blank">DOM</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Examples" target="blank">DOM Examples</a></li>
	<p>We'll cover DOM in detail in another class.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Okay, let's try a couple more lines: </p>
	<pre><code><c></c> document.body
<c></c> document.body.style
<c></c> document.body.style.color = "purple";</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Try this:</p> 
	<pre><code><c></c> document.write("Hello world!");</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<p>We could write our entire HTML document this way, but its easier to write some HTML and then modify it with JavaScript.</p>
	<pre><code><c></c> var elem = document.createElement("h1");
<c></c> elem.innerHTML = "JavaScript is kewl!";
<c></c> document.body.appendChild(elem);</code></pre>
</div>

<!--  variables, how js treats numbers, strings booleans -->
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Let's review <code>var</code> real quick.</h2>
	<p>In Javascript, every variable is declared as <code>var</code> regardless of what type of information it holds.  Soon we will discuss datatypes as they relate to JavaScript.  JavaScript only works with a few basic variable types: numbers, strings and booleans, along with arrays and objects and functions, which can all be declared with <code>var</code>. </p>
	<p>Variables in JavaScript are more easily converted into each other.  This is called type coercion and we'll talk about that more next week as well.</p>
	<p>For now, let's write some variables and then keep going.</p>
	<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var" target="blank">var on MDN</a></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<pre><code><c></c>var x;
<c></c>x = 10;
<c></c>x++; console.log(x);
<c></c>x;
<c></c>x += 10;
<c></c>x = x + 10;
<c></c>x = "ten";
<c></c>x = "10";
<c></c>x++;
<c></c>x = false;
<c></c>typeof x;</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Data storage: var, const, let</h2>
	<p>Creating a <code>var</code> stores information in the computer's memory with the name of the variable as a short code.  Starting in 2015, JavaScript introduced two new keywords for data storage: <code>const</code> and <code>let</code>.</p>
	<p><code>const</code> is short for <note>constant</note> and it make prevents the rebinding of values.  This means you can't assign a constant the value of 7 and then change it to 20.  Using different types of data storage improves the efficiency of a programming language, which is something that has been criticized about JavaScript since it's creation.</p>
	<p>More on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" target="blank">const</a>.</p>
	<p><code>let</code> is like <code>var</code> but block scoped.  This is a bit more complicated and we'll discuss it more later in the semester.  In theory, all JavaScript programs should be written using only <code>const</code> and <code>let</code>, but <code>var</code> is still acceptable in many cases and will work fine for many of the projects we do in class (plus I would have to rewrite all of my notes...)</p>
</div>


<!-- 
button
textarea
input
	text
	select, option
	
form
 -->

<div class="slide">
	<h2>button</h2>
	<p>A button element is one of the simplest input elements though it isn't as popular as it once was.  Here it is in HTML:</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;button id="sumbit"&gt;Click me.&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
	<p>We can also create one in the console:</p>
	<pre><code><c></c>var button = document.createElement("button");
<c></c>document.body.appendChild(button);
<c></c>button.id = "submit";
<c></c>button.innerText = "Click me!";</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>There are a lot of ways we can writes scripts to detect when the button is clicked.  This is a type of event, and we'll talk more in depth about events next week.  For now, let's write a very simple <code>event handler</code> to tell our program the button is clicked.</p>
	<pre><code>button.onclick = function(event) {
	console.log(this);
	console.log(event);
	alert("You clicked me :)");
};</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p><code>this</code> refers to the element the event listener is bound to.</p>
	<p><code>this</code> doesn't always refer to an element, in some cases it refers to funcion scope, but for now <code>this</code> will typically refer to an element bound to an event listener. More on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this" target="blank">this</a>.</p>
	<p><code>event</code> is an optional argument for the function that gives you data about the event itself, such as what type of event it was, the element, the position of the click within the element, modifier keys and other info.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>If you want to add an event listener to a HTML element that was not added with JavaScript, you need to get a reference to it first, and in most cases save that reference in a variable.</p>
	<pre><code>var button = document.getElementById("submit");</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>console.log</h2>
	<p><code>console.log()</code> is a special JavaScript function that can be used to report things that are happening in the program to the developer console.  Like all languages, we need a way to print things to the console to see what works and doesn't it.  It's extremely useful and easy to use, but you have to remember to be specific.  You can put pretty much anything in the argument parentheses for <code>console.log()</code>, so make sure it's something useful, like an element, a variable, or something else that you want to be able to read.  This is a good way to read data from various events.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>input</h2>
	<p>There are many different types of <code>input</code>.  Today we'll just use a text input:</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;input id="name" type="text" placeholder="Input name"&gt;</code></pre>
	<pre><code><c></c>var input = document.createElement("input");
<c></c>input.id = "name";
<c></c>input.placeholder = "Enter user name";
<c></c>document.body.insertBefore(input, button);</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We can use JavaScript to grad the value the user types in:</p>
	<pre><code>button.onclick = function() {
	var name = input.value;
};</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>textarea</h2>
	<p>A <code>textarea</code> is a resizable <code>input</code> for text.</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;textarea id="email" placeholder="Input email" &gt;</code></pre>
	<pre><code><c></c>var email = document.createElement("textarea");
<c></c>email.placeholder = "Add your email";
<c></c>email.id = "email";
<c></c>document.body.insertBefore(email, input);</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>select</h2>
	<p>A <code>select</code> element creates a dropdown input using the <code>option</code> element.</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;select id="borough"&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Bronx&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Manhattan&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Queens&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Staten Island&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<pre><code><c></c>var borough = document.createElement("select");
<c></c>borough.id = "borough";
<c></c>var bronx = document.createElement("option");
<c></c>bronx.value = "Bronx";
<c></c>bronx.innerText = "Bronx";
<c></c>borough.add(bronx);
<c></c>document.body.insertBefore(borough, button);</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Add it all up</h2>
	<p>Traditionally, we can place all of these elements into a <code>form</code> element, but we are not using any database or remote requests at this point, so we'll just use the elements and JavaScript to interact with them:</p>
	<pre><code>button.onclick = function() {
	var message = document.createElement("p");
	message.innerHTML = "Hello " + input.value + " from " + borough.value + ", welcome to my website.";
	document.body.appendChild(message);
};</code></pre>
</div>
