	<h2>Command line basics</h2>
	<p>On OSX, the command line is accessed through the Terminal program.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The command line is the only interface that offers the full functionality of Git.  Using the command line requires some basic familiarity with <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html" target="blank">Unix</a> and Git commands.</p>

	<h2>How to use Git</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Git is written to be used on the Linux command line, but because it is free and open source there are tools like GitHub that use interfaces to interact with git.</li>
		<li>Command line requires learning a little Unix but it's typically the best and most efficient way to interact with Git.  It's also the only way to access all of Git's features.</li>
		<li>GitHub's web interface allows the user to download, upload and edit code as well as forking and branching.</li>
		<li>GitHub's desktop client is a GUI interface for Git that is a little limited but can be a good place to start for visual learners</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Where is Git?</h2>
	<p>Git is a group of files that are hidden on your computer.</p>
	<img src="git/hiddenfiles.png" alt="">
	<p>When you create a new Git repository, Git will create a <code>.git</code> folder, which is hidden by default.  So you don't have to think about Git when you're looking at your project, but you know it's there. A set of files is referred to as a <code>repo</code> or <code>repository</code>.</p>
</div>



<!-- <div class="slide">
	<p>GitHub has an interface to upload files that will act like a command line commit by tracking changes.  You can upload new files and write a commit message.</p>
	<img src="git/upload.png" alt="">
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>GitHub also has a <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="blank">Desktop client</a>.  The functionality is limited, but you can do basic things like sync your files, write commit messages and view your history.  This can be a good interface for visual students to start using.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Essential Git commands</h2>
	<pre><code>$ git init</code></pre>
	<p>Use git init to initialize a new repository inside the root directory of the repo.</p>
	<img src="git/init.png" alt="">
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<pre><code>$ git status</code></pre>
	<p>Git status prints the current branch, changes staged for commit, changes to be committed, and any merge errors.  Use <note>git status</note> liberally.</p>
	<img src="git/status.png" alt="">
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>What files to track</h2>
	<p>Git is good at tracking and merging line-based text files like <note>.xml</note>, <note>.txt</note>, <note>.js</note>, etc.</p>
	<p>Git can track binary like images but it can't merge them.  It is a good idea to track files like <note>.png</note> or <note>.psd</note> but you can't merge and see the differences.</p>
	<p>Each snapshot that git takes increases the size of the <note>.git</note> folder hidden inside of your repo.  It's a good idea to keep the overall size of these files small if possible.  If you have cache or other files that are generated by various programs, but aren't necessary to build your project, like Sass cache files.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>.gitignore</h2>
	<p>The .gitignore is a hidden file that can be created in the root directory of your repo to tell git to ignore certain files or directions.  This is useful for ignoring cache files that can be regenerated, system files that aren't needed in the repo or any other files that you don't need to share in the repo.</p>
	<pre><code class="html">.DS_Store
sass-cache/
documentation/*.mov</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>add and commit</h2>
	<pre><code>$ git add &lt;path&gt;</code></pre>
	<p>Git add is used to stage files.  Git keeps track of any files that are added, modified or deleted in the root directory.  In order to commit those changes they must first be staged by adding.</p>
	<pre><code>$ git add . // adds all new and modified files
$ git rm &lt;path&gt; // removes files
$ git add -A // includes manually deleted files
$ git add &lt;path&gt; // commit specific file or directory
$ git add index.html
$ git add css/</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<pre><code>$ git commit</code></pre>
	<p>Commits staged files.  Each commit is referred to as a <note>snapshot</note>.  Snapshots are given unique identifier strings.</p>
	<pre><code class="html">$ git commit -a // includes modifications to tracked files
$ git commit -m "initial commit" // adds commit message as parameter</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Viewing history</h2>
	<pre><code>$ git log</code></pre>
	<p>Git log will print previous commits.  There are a lot of helpful options for this command.  You can modify Git commands with Unix parameters.  Parameters are written with one or two dashes and the parameter abbreviation or name.  ie: <note>-v or --version</note>.  To find the options for a specific command use <note>--help</note> or <note>-h</note></p>
	<pre><code class="html">$ git log -1 // logs most recent commit
$ git log -2 // two most recent commits
$ git log -p // shows difference in commits
</code></pre>
	<p>More on log: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History" target="blank">Viewing the Commit History</a></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Git hell</h2>
	<p>At some point every Git user will enter Git hell.  You try to push your new commit but you are told to pull first.  You pull.  You resolve the merge conflicts and commit.  You push.  And you're told to pull.  There are other versions of Git hell but they usually involve some sort of loop where you can't commit or push your changes.</p>
	<p>Don't feel bad and don't freak out!  Don't delete your repo and start over!</p>
	<p>Don't try random Git commands.</p>
	<p>Start on stack overflow and try to describe what happened.</p>
	<p>If you can't solve it on your own email me and we'll figure it out.</p>

	<h2>Branching</h2>
	<div data-src="git/master.json"></div>
	<p>By default each commit will be on the master branch.  Branching is a complex subject that we will cover more later in the semester.</p>
