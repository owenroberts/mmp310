<div class="slide">
	<p>Last week we used a loop to create a row of repeating shapes with variations.</p>
	<p>Now we will take loops a step further by creating a full grid using columns and rows.</p>
	<p>Programming make it easy to do the math to create a grid with a number of rows and columns.</p>
	<p>We can achieve this by putting one loop inside of another!</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Let's start by looking at how to divide the canvas into columns and rows.</p>
	<p>Columns are divisions in horiztonal space.  We can use the width of the canvas, and the number of columns we want, to set up the loop.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() { 
	createCanvas(640, 360);
	background(220);
	strokeWeight(2);

	// set the number of columns
	var columns = 6;

	// divide the canvas by that number to get each column width
	var columnWidth = width / columns;

	// draw a line at each column
	for (let x = 0; x <= width; x += columnWidth) {
		line(x, 0, x, height);
	}
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Next, we can divide the vertical space into rows.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() { 
	createCanvas(640, 360);
	background(220);
	strokeWeight(2);

	// set the number of rows
	var rows = 5;

	// divide the canvas by that number to get each row height
	var rowHeight = height / rows;

	// draw a line at each row
	for (let y = 0; y <= height; y += rowHeight) {
		line(0, y, width, y);
	}
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Now the trick is to combine them.  We could just copy the two loops next two each other, that would give us the appearance of a grid.</p>
	<p>But if we want to draw something at each module of that grid, we need to know the x and y of not just the columns and rows, but also the <em>intersection</em> of each column and row.</p>
	<p>For that we can use a <em>nested</em> for loop.  One loop inside of another.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() { 
	createCanvas(640, 360);
	background(220);
	strokeWeight(2);

	// simple example with text
	
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
			text(i + ", " + j, i * 50, j * 50);
		}
	}
}</div>
</div>
