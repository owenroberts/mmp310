<div class="slide">
	<p>So far we've built a prototype of the game working in the browser with keyboard events.</p>
	<p>Our next step is to take it into the mobile browser and add touch events.</p>
	<p>Touch interactions are different from mouse interactions in obvious ways, but they're also different in the way we work them in code, so we'll start to look at how to handle them today.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>To start, we need to change our development environment a bit.  Ideally, we could test directly on a mobile device, but it will be hard to set that up in class because our computers are restricted and everyone likely has different types of phones.</p>
	<p>The next best way is to use the Chrome device emulator.</p>
	<p>To start, open the Developer Tools (Command + Option + I) and then click on small devices icon left of the Elements tab, (Command + Option + M with browser window focused).</p>
