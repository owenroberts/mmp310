<div class="slide">
	<p>Last week we created a <code>Thing</code> class and then made an <code>Asteroid</code> class based on the generic <code>Thing</code>.</p>
	<p>In object oriented programming, one of the most important and fundamental concepts is <note>class inheritance</note>, which is the ability to create an class based on an existing class.</p>
	<p>Class inheritance can be used to simplify our code by looking at what properties and methods objects share and combining those into a base class.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>In this example game, we have a spaceship and asteroids.  They have similarities, they can both move, they are drawn with p5 graphics, the have a size and speed and position.</p>
	<p>What properties do they share?</p>
	<p>How are they different?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Let's create a <code>Spaceship</code> class and then compare to our <code>Asteroid</code> class.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<p>Let's start by comparing our <code>spaceship</code> object and our <code>Asteroid</code> class and seeing what properties are the same.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We created the <code>Asteroid</code> class already, so let's add the <code>Spaceship</code> class.</p>
	<p>We need a new <code>display</code> method to draw the spaceship, and a <code>move</code> method to look for player input and update the spaceship position.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">class Spaceship extends Thing {
	constructor() {
		super(width/2, height - 100, 100, 0, 0);
	}

	display() {
		noStroke();
		fill(255, 0, 255);
		ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.size);
	}

	move() {
		if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW)) {
			this.speedX = 5;
		} else if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)) {
			this.speedX = -5;
		} else {
			this.speedX = 0;
		}

		if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW)) {
			this.speedY = -5;
		} else if (keyIsDown(DOWN_ARROW)) {
			this.speedY = 5;
		} else {
			this.speedY = 0;
		}
	}
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The <code>move()</code> method looks for use input and then changes the speed of the spaceship based on the input.</p>
	<p>The <code>display()</code> method draws the spaceship on the canvas.</p>
	<p>The spaceship will use the <code>update()</code> method from the <code>Thing</code> class to change the position of the spaceship on the canvas.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Unlike the asteroids, we only have one spaceship on the canvas.  So we can declare the spaceship variable, create the spaceship in <code>setup</code> and then update the spaceship in <code>draw</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">var spaceship;
		
function setup() {
	spaceship = new Spaceship();
}

function draw() {
	spaceship.move();
	spaceship.update();
	spaceship.display();
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Notice how the spaceship also has the <code>move()</code> method called in <code>draw</code>, for user input.  The asteroids don't have this method.</p>
</div>



<div class="slide">
	<h2>Collision</h2>
	<p>To detect collisions between the Asteroids and Spaceship, we can add to our <code>Thing</code> class a new method, <code>collide</code>.</p>
	<p>This will take another object as a argument, calculate the size of the two objects and compare that to their distance.  This is very simple collision detection that will only work with two circle shaped objects.  For now, it's good enough to demonstrate for the example.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">class Thing {
	
	collide(other) {
		// calculate distance between the two
		var d = dist(this.x, this.y, other.x, other.y);
		
		// get the total size of both
		var s = this.size + other.size;
		
		/* if the distance between them is less than half their total size
			then they are collidiing */
		if (d < s/2) {
			textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
			textSize(100);
			text("YOU DIED", width/2, height/2);
			noLoop();
		}
	}

}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>For now we will just end the game.</p>
	<p>From here, imagine how you might add other components to the game, like a laser for the spaceship, or a power up.</p>
