<div class="slide">
	<p>In JavaScript, classes are a special kind of function that create an object definition.</p>
	<p>For our purposes, <em>class</em> and <em>object</em> mean the same thing.</p>
	<p>Generally, both terms refer to the programming practice of organizing code into objects, which can then be used as a <note>prototype</note>, a sort of <note>blueprint</note> for components of our program.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Classes are used to organize different types of objects in the game.  For our example we will use a spaceship for the player to control and asteroids as "enemies" for the player to avoid.</p>
	<p>Asteroids and spaceships have some common properties, they both needs to know the position on the canvas, the size, the speed and how to draw and update.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>In order to save time writing code, we'll define a basic idea of an asteroid as a <note>class</note>, and then use that class to create new asteroids.</p>
	<p>The <code>Spaceship</code> and <code>Asteroid</code> classes will share a lot of properties, so to simplify our code we can make a more generic class called <code>Thing</code> that will be used as the basis for our other classes.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The <code>Thing</code> class gets its own file, to keep our code more organized.</p>
	<p>create <note>Thing.js</note> and add it to the project folder.</p>
	<p>Remember to link to the file, before the <note>sketch.js</note> file so it can be used.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-err>&lt;script src="p5.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="Thing.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="Asteroid.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="sketch.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Constructor</h2>
	<pre><code>class Thing {
	constructor(x, y, size) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
		this.size = size;
	}
}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>This class declaration has no parentheses.  It defines a class, which contains information, so there are no arguments.</p>
	<p>Generally, class names are capitalized.  This makes it easier to distinguish them from other variables.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Classes have to include a special <code>constructor()</code> function, which can take arguments.  When an instance of the class is created, this function is classed to set the basic properties of the class.</p>
	<p><code>this</code> is used inside the class methods to make the data available to all methods in the object.  This is sort of like a global variable in a program, but within the scope of the object.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Update</h2>
	<p>Let's add a new function to update each thing.</p>
	<p>The update function will just move the thing.</p>
	<p>Since things can move left and right and up and down, we will use a speed value for both the x and y position.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">class Thing {
	constructor(x, y, size, speedX, speedY) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
		this.size = size;
		this.speedX = speedX;
		this.speedY = speedY;
	}
		
	update() {
		this.x += this.speedX;
		this.y += this.speedY;
	}
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Inheritance</h2>
	<p>In object oriented programming, one of the most important and fundamental concepts is <note>class inheritance</note>, which is the ability to create an class based on an existing class.</p>
	<p>Class inheritance can be used to simplify our code by looking at what properties and methods objects share and combining those into a base class.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>By making an <code>Asteroid</code> class that uses the base <code>Thing</code> class, we can just add the things that make the asteroid unique, it's position on screen and the display code to draw it.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">class Asteroid extends Thing {
	constructor() {
		var x = random(width);
		var y = -100;
		var size = random(50, 100);
		var speedX = random(-1, 1);
		var speedY = random(0, 3);
		super(x, y, size, speedX, speedY);
	}
	
	display() {
		// draw your asteroid
		// this.x, this.y for position
		// this.size
	}
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The <code>super</code> function is used to call the <code>constructor</code> of the base class.</p>
	<p>The <code>Asteroid</code> class uses the <code>update</code> method from the <code>Thing</code> class, but it has its own <code>display</code> method.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Instance</h2>
	<p>An <note>instance</note> of a class is one object based on the class prototype.  An isntance is created using the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>
	<pre><code>var thing = new Thing();</code></pre>
	<p>For asteroids, we will have a lot of them, so we can use an array to keep track of them and a loop to create and display them.</p>
	<p>This goes in our regular <code>sketch.js</code> file.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">var asteroids = [];

function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
	
	for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
		asteroids.push( new Asteroid() );
	}
}

function draw() {
	background('black');
	
	for (let i = 0; i < asteroids.length; i++) {
		asteroids[i].display();
		asteroids[i].update();
	}
}</div>
</div>
