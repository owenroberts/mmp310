title: Functions

<div class="slide">
	<p>Functions are blocks of code that can be called repeatedly.</p>
	<p>Functions are defined like variables but have parentheses following the function name.</p>
	<p>The parentheses <code>()</code> are used to <note>invoke</note> or call a function.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>There a two primary ways to create a function.</p>
	<div class="ex">// function declaration
function foo() {
	console.log("Hello :)");
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<div class="ex">// function statement 
var bar = function() {
	console.log("world");
}; // ends with semi color because it's a statement</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Notice how nothing happens after we declare the function.  The function is defined, but the code won't run until it is called:</p>
	<div class="ex">foo();
bar();</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>A function can also be written with <note>arguments</note>, which are variables that are declared within the parentheses of the function.</p>
	<p>Think of a function like a machine that performs a series of actions.  The actions are always the same, but the outcome may change depending on the arguments, or parameters.</p>  
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<p>Think of a function as a blender.  A blender is a machine that does one thing: It blends food together.</p>
	<p>Depending on what food you put into it, the result will be different.</p>
	<p>The ingredients you put in a blender are like arguments.</p>
	<p>If I put ice, milk, berries and bananas in a blender, I'll get a banana-berry smoothie.</p>
	<p>If I put kale, celery, apples and pineapples in a blender I'll get a green juice.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Let's write a function with arguments.</p>
	<div class="ex">function greet(name, greeting) {
	console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
}

greet("Jenny", "Hello");
greet("Jerry", "Hi");</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Now check what happens if we call the function with out arguments:</p>
	<div class="ex">greet();</div>
	<p>Why is this <code>undefined, undefined</code>?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The variables that are created for the arguments of the function, in this case <code>name</code> and <code>greeting</code> and declared when the function is invoked.</p>
	<p>So, even though we never wrote <code>var name;</code> or <code>var greeting;</code> they are created, and when a variable is declared but not assigned, it has the value <code>undefined</code>.  Because we did not call our function with the right arguments, those values stay undefined.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Return</h2>
	<p>Functions can also <code>return</code> values.  A return statement stops the function execution and returns a value to whatever variable the function is assigned to.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">function add(n1, n2) {
	return n1 + n2;
}
var x = add(2, 2);
var y = add(x, 2);
var z = add(x, y);
console.log(add(x, y, z));</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Anonymous functions</h2>
	<p>Regular JavaScript functions need to be called after they are declared.  There are cases where we want a function to run immediately. These are anonymous functions, which call themselves.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">(function() {
	console.log("Hello world");
})();</div>
	<br>
	<div class="ex">(function(msg) {
	console.log(msg);
})("Hello world.");</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Scope</h2>
	<p><span class="note">A quick note on scope:</span> Variables declared within a function are not available to other functions in our program.  Any variables declared in the <note>global</note> scope, or outside of any function, are available to function scopes.</p>
	<p>Read more on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#Implicit_globals_and_outer_function_scope" target="blank">scope</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Bad scope example:</p>
	<div class="ex">function assign() {
	var x = 0;
	var y = 1;
}
function add() {
	console.log(x + y);
}
assign();
add();</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Better scope example:</p>
	<div class="ex">var x; 
var y;
function assign() {
	x = 0;
	y = 1;
}
function add() {
	console.log(x + y);
}
assign();
add();</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>One common practice used to avoid this is to wrap all of the code in your script in a self invoking function, which will keep things out of the global scope.  Another approach is to make a global object that has methods to access variables which allows your script to be accessible in other scripts without exposing all of your variables to the global scope.</p>
