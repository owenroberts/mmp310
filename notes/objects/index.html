<div class="slide">
	<p>Although we haven't talked about them specifically, we have been using objects all semester.  In fact, basically everything in JavaScript is an object, including arrays, functions, and anything that has methods or properties.</p>
	<p>JavaScript is based on an object oriented programming design.  This means the language is organized around objects and data rather than logic and actions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Simply put, and object is a collection of properties and methods associated with one, well, object.</p>
	<p>Properties and methods are assigned with key value pairs.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Key, value pairs</h2>
	<p>In a key value pair, the key is a string and the value can be any JavaScript value, a number, string, array, function or another object.</p>
	<pre><code><table>
		<tr>
			<th>key</th>
			<th>value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>color</td>
			<td>"blue"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>length</td>
			<td>7</td>
		</tr>
	</table></code></pre>
	<p>Single values like numbers, strings and booleans are called <note>properties</note>, while functions are called <note>methods</note>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>For the Array object, <code>.length</code> is a property and <code>.push()</code> is a method.</p><p>An array is an object that contains key values for each of the elements in the array as well as other methods and properties.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<pre><code class="javascript">var fruit = ["banana.jpg", "orange.jpg", "kiwi.jpg"]; // array<table><tr>
			<th>key</th>
			<th>value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>"banana.jpg"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>"orange.jpg"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>"kiwi.jpg"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>length</td>
			<td>3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>push</td>
			<td>function() {}</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>pop</td>
			<td>function() {}</td>
		</tr>
	</table></code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Trains</h2>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Almost any object in the real world can be used as a metaphor for a JavaScript object.  Let's use trains.</p>
	<p>Like objects in the real world, JavaScript objects have properties and methods, or qualities and actions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Trains all have one basic blueprint.  This is like the object.</p>
	<p>A train has many properties, such as color, speed, number of passengers, distance traveled, origin and ending locations, etc.</p>
	<p>It also has actions, like functions, it moves on tracks, it honks it's horn, it carries passengers.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Object literal</h2>
	<p>Let's create a JavaScript version of a train:</p>
	<pre><code><c></c>var train = {
	speed: 60,
	numberOfPassengers: 500,
	distance: 100,
	origin: "Queens",
	destination: "Brooklyn"
};
<c></c>console.log(train);</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We can set and update properties of the train using dot notation <code>object.property</code>.</p>
	<pre><code>// add a new property "color"
<c></c>train.color = "blue";
// change an existing value
<c></c>train.numberOfPassengers = 400;
<c></c>console.log(train);</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Object properties can also be referenced with bracket notation:</p>
	<pre><code><c></c>train["color"];
<c></c>train["origin"];
<c></c>train["destination"] = "Manhattan";</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>So far we only have properties, so let's define a method:</p>
	<pre><code><c></c>train.getDuration = function() {
	return this.distance / this.speed;
};
<c></c>train.getDuration();</code></pre>
</div>



<div class="slide">
	<h2>Object constructor</h2>
	<p>Another way to create objects is through an object constructor, which is more like a blueprint for an object that get created later.</p>
	<pre><code>function Train(color, speed, distance, origin, destination) {
	this.color = color;
	this.speed = speed;
	this.distance = distance;
	this.origin = origin;
	this.destination = destiantion;
	this.getDuration = function() {
		return this.distance / this.speed;
	};
}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>new</h2>
	<p>With an object constructor the <code>new</code> keyword is used when creating a new object.</p>
	<pre><code><c></c>var cTrain = new Train("blue", 60, 100, "Queens", "Brooklyn");
<c></c>var twoTrain = new Train("red", 60, 200, "Bronx", "Brooklyn");</code></pre>
</div>
